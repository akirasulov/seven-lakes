All the listed lakes in different sources are summarized under the single name "Marguzor lakes", since Marguzor is the largest among them and is considered the most beautiful lake of all. They are also often referred to under the common names "Haftkul" (translated from Tajik as "seven lakes"), "Seven Beauties" and "Seven Beauties of Shinga". On the right bank there is a road carved into the rocks. On the northern slope grows a grove with tall trees and fragrant herbs. The lake is connected by channels from the south and north to the lakes Azorchashma and Khurdak, respectively. 4 rivers with a length of less than 10 km each flow into the lake.',
